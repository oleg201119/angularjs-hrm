                <h3 id="work-health-and-safety"><strong>1. General Disclaimer - Introduction</strong></h3>
                <p> Before you begin to use HRM&rsquo;s service, we need to outline some general principles and spell out some of your obligations concerning your use of the HRM Website.</p>
                <p><strong>You, the user, agree and  certify by logging into the website (www.hrmaster.com.au) that  you:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>(a). You have had the  opportunity to review these terms and conditions of use before accessing or  downloading any product;</strong><strong><br />
               <strong>(b). You consent to be  bound by the terms and conditions of use.</strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>2. HRM only sells  products to those who agree to be bound by these terms of use.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If you accept them, you may use our service and website however, if you do not, you are not permitted to use our service in that way.</p>
                <p>The application, functions and information contained within, is provided on the understanding that the HRM web page and its contents are not engaging (nor engaged), in providing any legal, industrial, work health and safety or any other professional or legal advice. Users wishing such advice should contact a legal practitioner or their professional body for further information.</p>
                <p>Together with any additional terms, conditions, notices and disclaimers contained on the HRM website, these terms and conditions of use regulate your use of the HRM website. Through your continued use of the HRM website, you acknowledge and agree that these terms and conditions of use constitute the rules and conditions of access to, use of and supply of information and products from the HRM website.</p>
                <p> All terms and conditions that govern your use of the HRM website (including disclaimers) may be amended by HRM from time to time. Changes apply from when the changes are updated however they will not be made retrospectively.</p>
                <p><strong>3. We provide General Legal  Information only</strong>. Legal information Is Not Legal Advice.</p>
                <p>This site provides general information about the law together with forms, manuals and sample documents designed to help users safely cope with their own legal needs. However it is not tailored to your specific circumstances. It is not the same as legal advice -- the application of law by someone trained to do so, to an individual's specific circumstances. The law is a personal matter and we have no knowledge of your personal circumstances when preparing our templates, manuals, guides or any other material. HRM and the HRM website is not a legal practice and does not provide Legal Advice, any more than any other textbook or guide can.</p>
                <p><strong>4. No warranty concerning  suitability of documents.</strong></p>
                <p> Although we go to great lengths to make sure our website functions and information is accurate and useful, we recommend you consult a lawyer if you want professional assurance that our information, and the way you are using it or interpreting it, is appropriate to your particular situation. All decisions you make on legal matters are your full responsibility. The legal, commercial and taxation effects of a document vary and a document's suitability will therefore vary according to particular circumstances. Only you know the purpose for which you intend to apply a document you order and that we are not responsible for the choice you make regarding the document that you order.</p>
                <p> Your use of the Site or any HRM service does not create a solicitor-client relationship between you and HRM. You accept full responsibility for reading our website and our information guides, and then determining whether any particular HRM template is suitable for any particular purpose and for protecting yourself against any possible consequential damages.</p>
                <p><strong>5. No warranty as to site&rsquo;s  continuing functionality.</strong></p>
